# Bug Fixes & Flow Validation Report

## 🐛 **Critical Bugs Found & Fixed**

### 1. **Missing Manager/Buddy Relationships**
**Issue**: Employee data lacked manager_id and buddy_id assignments
**Fix**: Added proper relationships to mock data
```javascript
// Before: No manager/buddy assignments
// After: Proper hierarchical structure
{ id: 3, manager_id: 1, buddy_id: 1 }
```

### 2. **Inconsistent Notification API Calls**
**Issue**: sendNotification() calls had wrong parameter counts
**Fix**: Standardized all notification calls to use proper signature
```javascript
// Before: sendNotification(id, type, message)
// After: sendNotification(id, type, title, message, link)
```

### 3. **Onboarding Status Mismatch**
**Issue**: Employee #3 had 'awaiting_it' but should be in progress for demo
**Fix**: Changed to 'onboarding_initiated' for better flow demonstration

### 4. **WebSocket Event Handling**
**Issue**: Real-time updates caused immediate re-renders without delay
**Fix**: Added 500ms delay for better UX and prevented race conditions

### 5. **Error Handling Missing**
**Issue**: No fallback data or error states in frontend
**Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms

### 6. **Manager Review Flow Bug**
**Issue**: Review submission didn't check for existing pending reviews
**Fix**: Added proper review validation and error messages
